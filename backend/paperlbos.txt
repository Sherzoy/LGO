XYZ Private Equity Partners purchases ABC Target Company for 5.0x Forward 12 months (FTM) EBITDA at the end of Year 0.
The debt-to-equity ratio for the LBO acquisition will be 60:40.
Assume the weighted average interest rate on debt to be 10%.
ABC expects to reach $100 million in sales revenue with an EBITDA margin of 40% in Year 1.
Revenue is expected to increase by 10% year-over-year (y-o-y).
EBITDA margins are expected to remain flat during the term of the investment.
Capital expenditures are expected to equal 15% of sales each year.
Operating working capital is expected to increase by $5 million each year.
Depreciation is expected to equal $20 million each year.
Assume a constant tax rate of 40%.
XYZ exits the target investment after Year 5 at the same EBITDA multiple used at entry (5.0x FTM EBITDA).
Assume all debt pay-down occurs at the moment of sale at the end of Year 5 (this eliminates the iterative/circular dependency between debt pay-down/cash balances and interest expense in a computer-based LBO model).

Valen Capital is considering a leveraged buyout of Ravello Refineries, a leading producer of oil
and industrial chemicals.
The company is planning to increase its CapEx significantly over the next several years to
support higher growth, even if its margins fall.
Valen plans to purchase the company for 10x LTM EBITDA, and it will use a Term Loan for 4x
EBITDA and Senior Notes for 2x EBITDA, with Investor Equity funding the remainder.
The Term Loan interest rate is 5%, and 2% of the initial principal must be repaid each year.
Additionally, 100% of the company’s Free Cash Flow will be used to make optional repayments
of the Term Loan.
The Senior Note interest rate is 10%, and no principal repayments are allowed.
Ravello’s LTM EBITDA is $250 million, and it spends 60% of its Revenue on COGS and 15% on
SG&A. D&A is not included in these COGS and SG&A figures and is a separate expense.
The company expects to grow its Revenue at 5.0%, 7.5%, 10.0%, 10.0%, and 10.0% over the
next 5 years, and SG&A as a % of Revenue will increase by 1% per year.
Ravello also plans to spend 8% of its Revenue on Capital Expenditures (CapEx) and 4% on the
Purchases of Intangible Assets. The Change in Working Capital will be a source of funds at 2% of
Revenue per year.
The company expects Depreciation & Amortization to represent 5% of its annual Revenue, and
its effective tax rate is 20%.
Valen Capital expects that it will be able to sell Ravello for 12x EBITDA at the end of the 5-year
holding period because of the higher growth rate.
If Valen Capital is targeting a 20% IRR over 5 years, would you recommend this deal? Estimate
the money-on-money multiple and IRR and show the FCF and Debt paydown calculations to
support your answer.
